	  		Welcome to Average Joe's Learning Games, created by a team of five computer science students at Ohio University. The purpose of the application is give middle-school/high-school students a way to solidify their understanding of concepts they are learning in school while also learning computational thinking. Currently the only game available is a physics ball launcher game that is intended to push students to use their understanding of motion to make a ball hit a target.

	  		To the right side of the game there is a computational visualization window with three tabs to show students a visual representation of some things happening in the code to give them a better understanding of what's going on behind the scenes. This visualization method is something that will be included in any future games added to the application.
